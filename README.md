# air_quality_sensor
This project is an Air Quality Monitor that uses an ESP32 microcontroller with gas sensors (MQ-2, MQ-135) and a dust sensor (GP2Y1010AU0F) to measure air pollution levels. The data is read from the sensors and displayed via serial monitor, OLED display, or sent to an IoT cloud platform
